# Simple GraphQL Demo

A very simple single file GraphQL API server using Express and Apollo.

## Get started

* Clone this repo
* `npm install` the dependencies
* `npm run start-dev` to launch the server
* Browse to `localhost:9000/visualise` to view the schema
* Browse to `localhost:9000/graphql` to access the playground
* Happy GraphQL Hacking

The `start-dev` script uses `nodemon`, so any changes in the code will restart the server to ensure the latest version is running.
